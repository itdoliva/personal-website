My main role in this project was to develop dashboard mockups. The project involved the understanding of the users' needs, the actions they wanted to take and the available data. Among the requirements, I emphasize that the pages should have fixed dimensions and the mockups should consider Tableau's possibilities and - specially - limitations.

I defined that I would have one page by subject. Before designing the high-fidelity mockup of a page, there was an iterative process of developing low-fidelity mockups to receive feedback from final users regarding the presented information and its structure.

The mockups presentation below was allowed by the contracting company after masking the data, the variable names, the page titles and the contracting company's logo.
