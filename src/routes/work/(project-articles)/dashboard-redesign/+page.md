He enhances the work by ensuring that the analytics are not only accurate but also meaningful. He combines this with an aesthetic that is hard to find. An A+ across the board.

At first, this project's request was only the visual reformulation of the User Interface (UI) in order to bring perceptions of sophistication, brightness and spaciousness. However, as usual, I asked what decisions the end user should make from the graphics and checked the available data and calculations made. From this understanding, I could suggest layouts, metrics, hierarchies, graphics, and organization best suited to meet the business objective.

The client wanted to keep the original charts - 3 BANs and 6 line graphs - and their layout. Still, I investigated the presented data and its calculations and found misunderstandings from the source extraction to the aggregations made in Tableau. The explanation of why the mistakes were made and the subsequent corrections ended up taking most of the project, but the feedback from the client was very gratifying.

For reasons like this, I constantly like to express the importance - when performing data visualization - of mastering data manipulation, transformation and aggregation and in understanding what tidy data is and the cautions to take when data is not presented in this structure. When working with BI tools, don't be satisfied with just a calculated field or an expression in DAX without error signaling. If you are not sure of the mechanism of operation of the internal calculations of the functions used, do tests, even if in pencil and paper, to verify if the result is really what is expected for that sample. For me, SQL was crucial in developing the above skills.
