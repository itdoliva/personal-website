excerpt: A dashboard developed for a top industry company in Brazil.
---

After joining the company as a senior data analyst, I realized that many analyzes I was doing could be transformed, facilitated and/or accelerated through a dashboard. Using PowerBI, I developed the department's dashboard from scratch, from data modeling to deployment.

At first, the dashboard would only attend my team and especially myself. For this reason, I have not defined fixed dimensions or done beyond simple paper sketches for each tab. However, in just a few months, the dashboard was already among the top 3 most accessed by the largest company in the sector in Brazil, with wide approval and use by several other departments.
